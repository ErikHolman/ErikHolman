- A Scavenger Hunt project. Participants race around the town we live in and solve puzzles with clues that help them learn about the town's history. Started as a multi-leg race with paper clues for family in the summer of 2020. Now we're going into year 5 it is time to ditch the paper clues. [React / TS / Vite].
