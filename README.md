### Hi there 👋
I'm Erik, a Full-Stack Developer crafting user-centric web apps. Currently using React, Node.js, and PostgreSQL to build both front-end and back-end functionalities. Successfully led cross-functional projects, improved user experience through UI redesign, and integrated data for seamless operation. Eager to expand skills and maintaining a growth mindset to contribute to a team building innovative solutions.

## 🔭 I’m currently working on:
- [Scavenger Race](https://github.com/ErikHolman/scavenger-race) (_PERN_)
  > Participants race around the town we live in and solve puzzles with clues that help them learn about the town's history. Started as a multi-leg race with paper clues for family in the summer of 2020. Now we're going into year 5 it is time to ditch the paper clues.
